# Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Igor! I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** with expertise in building scalable applications across the entire stack. I specialize in **frontend development** and backend systems using **Node.js**, **Java**, and **Python**.

💼 Always working on diverse projects and exploring new POCs to push technical boundaries.  
🎨 Strong focus on clean UI/UX with **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and modern CSS frameworks.  
⚙️ Backend experience with **Spring Boot**, **Express**, **FastAPI**, and RESTful/GraphQL APIs.  
🧪 Advocate for best practices: testing, CI/CD, and maintainable architecture.  
🚀 Fun fact: I believe the best code is the one that's never written (when a library does it better).
